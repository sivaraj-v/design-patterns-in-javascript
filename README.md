## :rocket: What are Design Patterns?
Design Patterns are the solutions to commonly occuring problems in software design. These patterns are easily re-usable and are expressive.

According to Wikipedia

> In software engineering, a software design pattern is a general reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design. It is not a finished design that can be transformed directly into source or machine code. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.

## Types of Design Patterns
* [Creational](#creational-design-patterns)
* [Structural](#structural-design-patterns)
* [Behavioral](#behavioral-design-patterns)

## Creational Design Patterns
Creational Design Patterns will create objects for you instead of instantiating an object directly.

According to Wikipedia
> In software engineering, creational design patterns are design patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. The basic form of object creation could result in design problems or added complexity to the design. Creational design patterns solve this problem by somehow controlling this object creation.
