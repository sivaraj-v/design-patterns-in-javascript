## :rocket: What are Design Patterns?
Design Patterns are the solutions to commonly occuring problems in software design. These patterns are easily re-usable and are expressive.

According to Wikipedia

> In software engineering, a software design pattern is a general reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design. It is not a finished design that can be transformed directly into source or machine code. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.
